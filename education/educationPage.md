# Education

I received by Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My emphasis was in digital signal processing with applications to audio. Projects included room acoustic measurement by recording impulse responses and analyzing frequency response in MATLAB and development of common audio effects in Max/MSP.

I received my Master of Science in Audio Engineering from Belmont University. Emphasis was in audio algorithm and software development using MATLAB, Python, and C++, as well as machine learning for audio classification and source separation. My masters thesis involved a perceptual evaluation of the Non-negative Matrix Factorization algorithm used for audio source separation (more information can be found [here](https://rjmiller927.github.io/research/mastersThesis.html)). Additional studies included acoustics, psychoacoustics, critical listening, audio research methods, and studio recording.
